    <h4>Simple breakfast or brunch chocolate_chip_pancakes_recipe for the family</h4>

    <p>chocolate chip pancakes that are light and fluffy and loaded with gooey chocolate. You can also sprinkle the chocolate chips on top once the pancakes are on the griddle instead of folding them into the batter — that way you can adjust the amount of chocolate chips per pancake.</p>

    <p>its an easy, gooey meal that can be topped with whatever you like. When served warm, the chocolate chips melt in your mouth.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>

    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        
    <li>1 large egg</li>
        
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        
    <li>½ cup mini chocolate chips, or more to taste</li>
        
    <li>cooking spray</li>
  </ul>

    <P><li>Whisk egg, butter, and vanilla extract into buttermilk mixture until well combined; add flour mixture and whisk until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. The pancake batter will be thick. Allow batter to rest for 5 minutes.</li></P>
